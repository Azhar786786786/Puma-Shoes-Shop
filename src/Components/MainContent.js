      This is a tale of murder. Or maybe that's not quite true. At its heart, it's a love story, isn't it?

      One spring morning, reclusive ex-movie star Lana Farrar invites a small group of her closest friends for a weekend away, on her small private island, just off the coast of Mykonos.

      Beneath the surface, old friendships conceal violent passions and resentments. And in forty-eight hours, one of them will be dead.

      But that was just the beginning...

      You may think you know this story. Think again.
